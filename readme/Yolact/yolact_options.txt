batch_size              Batch size for training.
resume                  Checkpoint state_dict file to resume training from. If this is "interrupt", the model will resume training from the interrupt file.
start_iter              Resume training at this iter. If this is -1, the iteration will be determined from the file name.
num_workers             Number of workers used in dataloading.
cuda                    Use CUDA to train model.
lr                      Initial learning rate. Leave as None to read this from the config.
momentum                Momentum for SGD. Leave as None to read this from the config.
decay                   Weight decay for SGD. Leave as None to read this from the config.
gamma                   For each lr step, what to multiply the lr by. Leave as None to read this from the config.
save_folder             Directory for saving checkpoint models.
config                  The config object to use.
save_interval           The number of iterations between saving the model.
validation_size         The number of images to use for validation.
validation_epoch        Output validation information every n iterations. If -1, do no validation.
keep_latest             Only keep the latest checkpoint instead of each one.
keep_latest_interval    When --keep_latest is on, don't delete the latest file at these intervals. This should be a multiple of save_interval or 0.
dataset                 If specified, override the dataset specified in the config with this one (example: coco2017_dataset).
